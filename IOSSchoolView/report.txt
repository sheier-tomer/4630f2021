The project I have been working on for this semester in Mobile App Programming I is something I call “School View.” School View is a school rating app that is 
based on student or visitor reviews. To start off, what problem exactly is this app trying to solve? The problem is that there is no simple way for students to 
view how well a university is doing based on important factors, being academics, athletics, housing, dining, social life, faculty, and many more. There is also no 
quick way for rising college undergrads to view which school they want to enroll in based on these categories. I only had one approach for this problem in mind, and
I feel like it has been working.
