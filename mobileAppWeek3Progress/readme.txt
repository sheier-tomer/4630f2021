Week 3 Progress: 11/17/2021

I have created a homepage with the layout I presented during the project proposal presentations. I think this layout is easy for the user to navigate around the
app. It is however no where close to be finished. The buttons on the login screen and homepage have no functionality yet. I have also created a launch screen for 
app.

I could not get enough progress in this week due to me having multiple exams.
