1) I have not thought of anything new since last class unfortunatly. 
2) I personally believe that the safest way to going about monetizing an app is throught ads. It keeps the app free for the users and it gives the developers/the company revenue. 
However, many developers use ads for their free apps in a very preditory way. For example, pop-up ads that make you stop whatever you're doing, with no way of closing the ad 
unless waiting a few seconds. developers sometimes use this method of ads to promote a paid version of the same app. Like for example, a "premium" version with a couple more features
and no ads. 
3) In my opinion, snapchat has a very nice UI. There are so many features that happen to not clutter the screen in any way. The app is divided into 5 simple tabes that can be 
accessed through the bottom of the screeen. theres maps, chat, camera, news/stories, and spotlight (sort of like tiktok). 
4) Unfortunatly I still do not have an idea for an app that I will be developing in this class. I am constantly thinking about the ideas of my peers and I even talked to my father
who has experience with app development. I am sure very soon I will have something.
