Week 5 Progress: 12/1/2021

I have been able to link the login view and the homepage view. If the user presses the button that says "create account," the app will take the user to the next
page, being the homescreen. The Searchbar is able to accept text, however there is no real functionality to it yet. The rating stars in the homescreen view have 
functionality and are able to change by a press of the user. 

Very soon I will have the category buttons have functionality and take the user to the respective page.
