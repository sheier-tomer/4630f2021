Week 2 Progress: 11/10/2021

I have decided to switch my project over to XCode instead of committing on using Android Studio. I feel like this is a good change because I am able to 
test my app on my own iPhone instead of having android studio take ages to load an emmulator. XCode is better optimized so it runs smoother unlike Android studio.

This week I have been watching a 3 hour course on how to use XCode (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09TeUXjzpKs). I used the knowledge I gained to create a login 
screen for School View. The buttons do not have functionality yet but they will in the next couple of days.
